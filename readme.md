# DjangoDemo

This repository contains code for experimentation with and learning Django.

The contents of the demo project are mainly based on a [tutorial by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIg40xs9e4).

The musicDemo project is a prototype for a website for searching for storing and searching for songs in a database, allowing the user to view, filter and search songs in a database.
