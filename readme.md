# DjangoDemo

This repository contains code for experimentation with and learning Django.

The contents of the demo project are mainly based on a [tutorial by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIg40xs9e4).

The musicDemo project is a prototype for a website for searching for storing and searching for songs in a database, allowing the user to view, filter and search songs in a database.

# Music Database Website
Here you can see what the home page of the website currently looks like.

Here is an image of what the main database page (called playlist page) of the website looks like. This page has the option to search, as well as sort the list of songs.
